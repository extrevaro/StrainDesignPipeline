# StrainDesignPipeline

Welcome to **StrainDesignPipeline**! This repository provides a modular and extensible pipeline for strain design and metabolic engineering, helping researchers and practitioners streamline computational workflows for microbial strain optimization.

## Overview

**StrainDesignPipeline** aims to automate and simplify the process of generating, simulating, and analyzing strain designs for metabolic engineering projects. The pipeline integrates various computational tools and algorithms to guide users from data preprocessing to actionable strain recommendations.

## Features

- **Automated Workflow:** Standardizes and automates common steps in strain design.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extend or substitute modules for specific tasks (e.g., FBA, gene knockout analysis).
- **Integration:** Connects with metabolic models and simulation frameworks.
- **Data Analysis:** Includes scripts for post-simulation analysis and visualization.
- **Reproducibility:** Supports configuration files and logging for reproducible science.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/extrevaro/StrainDesignPipeline.git
cd StrainDesignPipeline
```

Install dependencies (if any):
```bash
# Example for Python projects:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Configure Your Project:**
   - Edit configuration files (e.g., `config.yaml`) to match your model and design objectives.

2. **Run the Pipeline:**
   - Execute the main script to start the workflow.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python main.py --config config.yaml
     ```

3. **Analyze Results:**
   - Output files and analysis reports will be generated in the `results/` directory.
